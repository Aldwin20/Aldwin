They are new every morning:<br>
great is thy faithfulness."<br>

Faith is key in business and in a lifetime of happiness. For those of us who are believers, it is important that we witness to non-believers <br> what God has done for us. He died for us on the cross, so that all sin is forgiven, and that we would have everlasting life.
